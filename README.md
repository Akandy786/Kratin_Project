- Project Title :- HealthPal
- Description :-
                HealthPal is an online platform for the people of age more than 65. In this, we have provided three roles 
                i) User
                ii) Doctor
                iii) Medical Store / pharmacy
                All three can register themselves under roles suitable for them. After registering and logged in User can Search for the medical stores as well as Doctors in the nearby area(Here, the area will be choosen based on the PIN code provided by User). He can fix an appointment with doctor with the ease of time of both User as well as Doctor. Also, In case of Medical Emergency, User can directly connect to doctor and ask his advice regarding situation. This will help him to avoid any critical situation about his health.
               Also User can order medicine from the medical store by Mobile number provided by medical store at the time of its registration. 

Future Scope :-
              1) We are planning to provide online links (URL of videos) for the Better practice of Yoga and Healthcare Diet. There will be a section which will keep track of the Exercise you have done and the amount of calories you have burnt. Also, How you follow diet will also be monitored, for that you have to upload your eating habits and Diet tips. We can also provide online consultation by the health nutrition experts.  
              2) Providing information about the health checkup camps (Both from Private as well as Government). If any Govt. Scheme is available for the people of this age group, this will also be displayed or will be informed to the people belonging to that area.
              
Incomplete Part :-              
                  Due to lack of time, I was not able to complete the Front-End part(Major work will be on technology -> ReactJS,BOOTSTRAP,CSS,HTML). If time permits and opportunity given I will definitelty try to improve this and make the most out of it.
